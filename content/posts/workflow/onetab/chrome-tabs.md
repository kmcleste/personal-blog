summary: Reduce the amount of active tabs taking up precious memory by using OneTab

As many of you may know, Google Chrome **loves** to eat up memory. There are certainly workarounds or alternative solutions but Google Chrome has become integral to many people's daily routines. So, instead of finding a new browser or expecting Google to do something good on behalf of their users, we can use a clever extension called "OneTab". If you're anything like me and often find yourself with 20+ tabs open and are unable to actually find anything you need, this may be of use to you.

Simply head on over to the Google Chrome Extension Store and search for "OneTab". Alternatively, you can go directly to the install [page here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall). Installation is as easy as clicking "Add to Chrome".

Upon clicking the funnel icon in your task bar, OneTab will create a list of your open web pages. These web pages can then be opened at a later time if you ever need them (similar to bookmarking). OneTab also allows you to be backup your saved pages, as well as import links.

Once you have saved some links, selecting the "More..." option will enable you to name groups of links. You can see an example of this below where I have named several groups of links based on their content:

These groupings allow you to quickly categorize webpages and save them for later, while also reducing the amount of tabs you actively have open.
